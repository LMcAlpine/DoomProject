## Objective:

This is a project to read and interpret WAD files, the data storage format for Doom and Doom-engine-based games.

## Technologies Used:

 It uses C++ to read the byte data of a WAD. Google Test Framework is used for unit testing.

## Challenges:

The challenges faced during this project related to understanding endianness, memory layout, byte representation, unit testing in C++ with a Test-Driven Development approach, and feature branching with Git and Github.

## Skills Demonstrated:

This work demonstrates knowledge of file handling, data parsing, memory layout, endianness, byte representation, test-driven development, and git.

## Goals:

Focusing on bit-level operations, binary data manipulation, and hexadecimal operations will help me better understand low-level programming. I aim to expand my knowledge of graphics programming, work with low-level data formats, and optimize for performance and reliability.
